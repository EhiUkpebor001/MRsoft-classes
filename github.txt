Github is an online platform that helps developers store, manage and collaborate on coding projects. It is built around Git, which is a version control system, that tracks changes made to files in a project.


What is Version Control System?
A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects, and enable them to collaborate on those projects. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.


ABOUT READMEs
You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

* What the project does
* Why the project is useful
* How users can get started with the project
* Where users can get help with your project
* Who maintains and contributes to the project


Ignoring files
You can configure Git to ignore files you don't want to check in to GitHub.
