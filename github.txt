Github is an online platform that helps developers store, manage and collaborate on coding projects. It is built around Git, which is a version control system, that tracks changes made to files in a project.


What is Version Control System?
A version control system allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects, and enable them to collaborate on those projects. Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.
